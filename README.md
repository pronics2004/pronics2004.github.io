Prasanna Sattigeri is a Principal Research Scientist at IBM Research AI and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, where his primary focus is on developing reliable AI solutions. His research interests encompass areas such as generative modeling, uncertainty quantification, and learning with limited data. His current projects are focused on the governance and safety of large language models (LLMs), aiming to establish both theoretical frameworks and practical systems that ensure these models are reliable and trustworthy. He has played a significant role in the development of several well-known open-source trustworthy AI toolkits, including AI Fairness 360, AI Explainability 360, and Uncertainty Quantification 360.
